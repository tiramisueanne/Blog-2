The different definitions of consent show the huge range of what it can mean to people. Two understandings of consent are “Consent doesn’t have to be verbal..” (Rainn) and “Consent to Sexual Activity is ...A conversation that requires consciousness and clarity.” (UT CMHC) The advantage of a conversation is that it’s clear to both parties what is acceptable. On the other hand, the majority of consent uses nonverbal cues, as it’s less awkward in context. Certain situations, such as severe power imbalances, can pressure one party into giving “consent” as a payment for avoiding or gaining consequences. This would be a violation of duty-based ethics, as the person in charge has an obligation to not reduce the victim’s personal autonomy for the powerful person’s own gain.


Louis C.K’s allegations of sexual assault and harassment are numerous, and the outspoken victims allow for analysis of ethics from both sides. A woman who had worked under C.K. had been propositioned to watch him masturbate in the workplace. She says, “‘I think the big piece of why I said yes was because of the culture,’ she continued. ‘He abused his power.’” Her recollection is indicative of a toxic power dynamic getting in the way of valid consent, as described above. Louis C.K. apologized to some of these women before any allegations came out. One woman, who rebuffed him after he proposed masturbating in front of her in a locker room, said “...he told me he had issues.” (NYT) His knowledge of the morality of this question makes his continued behavior worse in terms of intent, as he knew what he was doing was wrong. 

Some see technology as a way to solve the issue with consent, an example being LegalFling, an app that promises “to be ‘the first blockchain-based app to verify explicit consent before having sex.” (Zarya). According to the duty-based ethics, the intent of the app is to make communicating consent easier. However, using the consequentialist framework, using an app to document consent is awkward, and therefore no one is going to use or gain value from it. Another app, Good2Go, “doesn’t tell users is that it keeps a private record of every ‘I’m Good2Go’ agreement logged in its system”, which is a breach of privacy and therefore unethical from the lens of the consequentialist framework (Hess).
